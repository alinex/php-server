Alinex Server
=============

PHP Development Platform

About Alinex
------------

Alinex is a collection of stable, flexible and strong integrated components to make a base system for any powerful web application. Web applications are used more and more also with the new term 'working in the cloud' and the big market share of tablet computers and smartphones. In contrast to traditional applications there is no installation for each user neccessary and it can be used anytime and anywhere. This applications can also be used from pocket devices like mobile phones.

To reach this there are allready a lot of frameworks which help in development, but often they are very complex and not flexible enought. The hardest part in web applications are the client programming and just this is often not supported well by most frameworks. Alinex aims this and will give better support to make robust and powerful interfaces without to much effort. This is solved not as one major system but as a base plattform with lots of intercorporating modules.
