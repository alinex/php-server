Backport Classes
==============

The Classes within this directory are meant as replacements for PHP older than
the specified version (directory name).

They will be loaded on demand through the autoloader see
Alinex\Code\Autoloader::addBackports() method.

Therefore all classes have to be put in a directory with the version number
in which the class was added.
